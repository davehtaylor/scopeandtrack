# Scope&Track

### Endoscope decontamination and reprocessing log

Scope&Track streamlines the process of logging for endsocope reprocessing. It will allow an endocopy facility to centralize their logs for each scope processing, track scopes that are in and out of service, track DSD machine maintenance, filter change cycles, and which technicians performed each task. Instead of numerous paper binders, Scope&Track will keep the log information in one, easy-to-use interface.

Scope&Track will be driven primarily through an iPad application. Technicans will log all their activites as they process the endoscopes. Planned features:

- Query past logs
- Reminders for upcoming maintenance tasks
- Visual remdinders for scopes that are out of service
- Logs for each consumable component in the process

A web interface will also be used by the facility administration to create users, scopes, and DSD machines, view logs, and perform administrative tasks. 

The web frontend is being developed in React, and the API is being devleoped in Python with Flask and SQLAlchemy ORM.
